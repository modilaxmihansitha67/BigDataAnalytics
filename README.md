📊 Agricultural Market Data Analytics Project Workflow

🧩 1. Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a structured Big Data Analytics workflow for agricultural market data using PySpark and Pandas within Jupyter Notebook.
The project explores how large-scale commodity arrival data (over 21,000 records) across different districts, taluks, and markets can be transformed, analyzed, and visualized to uncover market-level insights.

⚙️ 2. Inferred Analysis Workflow

The dataset contains 10 key attributes — District Name, Taluk Name, Market Name, Address, Telephone, Commodity, Year, Month, Arrival, and Unit.
The workflow focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing these fields to identify commodity trends and market behaviors.

🪜 Step-by-Step Workflow
🔹 Step 1: Data Ingestion & Schema Detection

The CSV file is read into PySpark DataFrames with inferred schema to automatically detect column types like strings, integers, and dates.

🔹 Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation

Trimming whitespace from text fields (e.g., Commodity, Unit)

Handling missing or inconsistent entries

Standardizing column names and data formats

🔹 Step 3: Data Exploration

Initial analysis involves inspecting:

Distinct Districts, Taluks, and Markets

Commodity frequency

Yearly and monthly record distribution

🔹 Step 4: Data Transformation using RDDs & DataFrames

Conversion from RDDs to DataFrames enables efficient distributed operations such as:

Filtering by commodity or year

Deriving total arrivals per commodity and market

Creating new computed columns (e.g., “Annual_Average_Arrival”)

🔹 Step 5: Sampling & Aggregation

Sampling functions (sample(), takeSample()) are used to examine subsets of the data.
Group-by and aggregation operations summarize key insights:

Total arrivals by Commodity

Comparison of arrivals across Markets and Years

🔹 Step 6: Analytical Insights

Using PySpark DataFrame APIs, operations include:

Aggregation: groupBy('Commodity').agg(sum('Arrival'))

Sorting: Identify top 10 commodities by arrival volume

Temporal Analysis: Trends of major commodities by month/year

🔹 Step 7: Visualization & Insights (Mini Project)

Final stage visualizes patterns and relationships using Pandas and Matplotlib:

Top commodities by total arrival

Seasonal arrival patterns (Month-wise)

Market-wise performance comparison

🧠 3. Key Learnings and Concepts
